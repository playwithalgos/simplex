## Features

- simple to use. You even do not have to click on a button "Execute"!
- input in text form for instance
   ````
   max 2x + 3y
    x <= 1
    2x + 6y <= 1
   ````

- you can use (almost) any names for variable as long it starts with a letter ;)

  ````
   max 2chocolate + 3milk
    chocolate <= 1
    2chocolate + 6milk <= 1
   ````

  also works!

- only maximization problem in canonical form
